# README - Content Guidelines

## Purpose of This Folder
This folder contains the knowledge base for the Mini Naresh chatbot. The content in these files will be used to provide accurate and relevant responses about your portfolio, skills, projects, and experience.

## How to Use These Files
1. Replace the placeholder text in each file with your actual information
2. Maintain the Markdown format for better processing
3. Be as detailed as possible for better chatbot responses
4. Keep information factual and professional

## Folder Structure
- `/personal`: Personal information and response guidelines
- `/projects`: Detailed information about your projects
- `/skills`: Your technical and soft skills
- `/experience`: Work experience and professional roles
- `/education`: Academic background and achievements

## Adding New Content
To add new content:
1. Create a new Markdown (.md) file in the appropriate subfolder
2. Follow the template structure used in existing files
3. After adding new content, the system will need to reprocess the documents (this happens automatically when the API key is provided)

## Content Best Practices
- Be specific and provide concrete examples
- Include metrics and achievements where possible
- Maintain a consistent tone and level of detail
- Avoid sensitive personal information you wouldn't want shared
